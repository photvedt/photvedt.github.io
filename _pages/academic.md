## My Work

I am currently doing research under Dr. Sean Fain in the Medical Physics department here in Madison. My research focuses on using MRI and CT images of lungs to quantify levels of functional small airways disease. 

Outside of the Fain Lab, I am currently engaged in my senior design project with Noah Schweitzer and Tomas Montenegro. Updates on this project will come in time, so stay tuned!


## My Talks and Presentations

## Miscellaneous Projects

Every once in a while, I'll get the itch to try to apply my academics to something outside of the conventinoal "academic" field. These are some of those examples:
  
  + Stochastic Processes and Random Walks seen in Twitch Play Pokemon Red
    - In early 2018, I gave a brief undergraduate-level presentation to my peers for a Math club event on how Twitch Plays Pokemon Red was a very simple example of stochastic processes. the MATLAB code is currently lost/hiding, but the presentation slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oYtfXlcirFioiPu01lY11hX9zY8KAu6X3OXJk_LIddk/edit?usp=sharing)
