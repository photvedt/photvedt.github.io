## My Academic Work

Click [here](https://photvedt.github.io/academic/selected_works/) to see some of my selected reports I've written for my ccourses, inlcuding my senior design project.


## My Undergraduate Research

I am currently doing research under Dr. Sean Fain in the Medical Physics department here in Madison. My research focuses on using MRI and CT images of lungs to quantify levels of functional small airways disease. This research is to be published soon!

## My Talks and Presentations

Click [here](https://photvedt.github.io/academic/talks/) to see some of my presented works from conferences and/or other events.

## Miscellaneous Projects

Every once in a while, I'll get the itch to try to apply my academics to something outside of the conventinoal "academic" field. These are some of those examples:
  
  + Stochastic Processes and Random Walks seen in Twitch Play Pokemon Red
    - In early 2018, I gave a brief undergraduate-level presentation to my peers for a Math club event on how Twitch Plays Pokemon Red was a very simple example of stochastic processes. the MATLAB code is currently lost/hiding, but the presentation slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oYtfXlcirFioiPu01lY11hX9zY8KAu6X3OXJk_LIddk/edit?usp=sharing).
