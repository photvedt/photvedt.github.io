## My Current Research

I am a first-year student in the Orion Radiation Measurement Group under Dr. Zhong He at the University of Michigan. I have an interest in applications of radiation imaging and image reconstruction!

## My Undergraduate Research

My undergraduate research was done under Dr. Sean Fain in the Medical Physics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research focused on using MRI and CT images of lungs to quantify levels of functional small airways disease. This research is to be published soon!
