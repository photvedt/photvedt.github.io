# Selected Academic Works
This page contains some of my selected papers from my academic career that I am proud of.

## Graduate Work
- Coming Soon!

## Undergraduate Work

+ [An Analysis of Using a Subcritical Reactor Design to Produce Molybdenum-99 using Uranium Targets](/files/Senior_Design_NTP___Final_Draft___Updated.pdf) - Senior Design Project
  - This is my senior design project I worked on with Noah Schweitzer and Tomas Montenegro place during the Spring 2020 Semester. Given the timing of this project and the global pandemic, I am pleased with how the project turned out. 
  
+ [LINAC Vault Shielding Design Project](/files/569_Final_Report__WEBSITE_.pdf) - Health Physics
  - This report deteremines the proper shielding design for a hypothetical LINAC vault. It was done in a group as my final project for a general graduate-level Health Physics course. My work primarily consisted on the door shielding design. 
  
+ [Use of Adaptive k-means clustering for Lung Image Segmentation](/files/Hotvedt_MP574_Final_Report.pdf) - Imaging in Medicine: Applications
  - This is the final report for The Applications in Medical Imaging course I worked on with Noah Schweitzer. It covers the mathematics behind the algorithm adaptive k-means clustering algorithm and the methodology of replicating part of the research conducted by Dr. Fain's lab.
