Hi there, how are you today? 

My name is Peter Hotvedt. I am senior undergraduate student studying Nuclear Engineering and Applied Mathematics, at the University of Wisconsin Madison from which I will be graduating December 2020! 

This is my personal website! Anything you might want to know about me academically or professionally will be hosted here.

This page is still under construction, so I appreciate your patience as I continue to build it!
