Hi there, how are you today? 

My name is Peter Hotvedt. I am a second year Nuclear Engineering PhD student at the University of Michigan in Dr. Zhong He's [Orion Radiation Measurement Group](https://cztlab.engin.umich.edu/)! My current research focuses on radiation imaging using our CdZnTe radiation detectors! I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Nuclear Engineering with an additional degree in Applied Mathematics and a certificate in Physics, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2020.

This is my personal website! Anything you might want to know about me academically or professionally will be hosted here.

My current CV (as of July 19, 2022) can be found here: [Peter Hotvedt's CV](/files/Peter_Hotvedt_CV.pdf)

This website is always developing and changing, so I encourage you to come back every so often to see what's new with me!
