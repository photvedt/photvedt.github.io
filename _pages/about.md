Hi there, how are you today? 

My name is Peter Hotvedt, I'm senior undergraduate student rising into my 5th year, and my final semster at the University of Wisconsin Madison! I am currently studying Nuclear Engineering and Applied Mathematics, and I'll be graduating with degrees in both in December of 2020. I have done research as an undegraduate assistant in Dr. Sean B. Fain's Lab  in the field of Medical Physics, with a specific focus on medical imaging.
