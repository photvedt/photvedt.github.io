Hi there, how are you today? 

My name is Peter Hotvedt. I am a future first year Nuclear Engineering PhD student at the University of Michigan in Dr. Zhong He's [Orion Lab](https://cztlab.engin.umich.edu/)! I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Nuclear Engineering with an additional degree in Applied Mathematics and a certificate in Physics, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

This is my personal website! Anything you might want to know about me academically or professionally will be hosted here.

My current CV (as of December 22, 2020) can be found here: [Peter Hotvedt's CV](/files/Peter_Hotvedt_CV___202012__WEBSITE_.pdf)

This website is always developing and changing, so I encourage you to come back every so often to see what's new with me!
