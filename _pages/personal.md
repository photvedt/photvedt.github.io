Everyone has to have hobbies right?

##Running
Here is my [strava profile](https://www.strava.com/athletes/48410519). Since I started college, I've taken up running and come to really enjoy it. During the winter I usuall y have to run around a track, but it if warms up enough, I enjoy going for running adventures, which are usually logged on Strava. In 2019, I had a resolution to run a half marathon, and this year in 2020 , that resolution has doubled into running a full marathon before the end of the year.
