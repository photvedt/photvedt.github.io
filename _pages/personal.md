Everyone has to have hobbies, right?

## Streaming
I enjoy streaming over on [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/voltage12o2) on a regular basis. It's a nice way for me to catch up with friends on a regular basis while playing games and chatting with an audience. I am a variety streamer, and I usually stream games I've never played before with friends, I invite my Voice Acting friends to dub a game, or I just play through games I'm familiar with for viewer entertainment. More information about what I've played can be found in the 'About' section of my channel

## Running
Here is my [strava profile](https://www.strava.com/athletes/48410519). Since I started college, I've taken up running and come to really enjoy it. During the winter I usually have to run around a track, but it if warms up enough I enjoy going for running adventures, which are usually logged on Strava. In 2019, I had a resolution to run a half marathon, and this year in 2020 that resolution has doubled into running a full marathon before the end of the year.

## Voiceover
I have been doing various voiceover gigs, including eLearning Narration, commercial work, and character acting, for a little over two years. My voiceover website is presently under construction, but will be linked here when complete! You can find my [Voiceover CV by clicking here!](/files/Peter_Hotvedt_CV___Voiceover (2).pdf)
