# Voice Work
This page is currently under construction but will soon feature my current demo reel and booth sample.

## My Specs

 - I record on a Rode NT1-A with a Steinberg UR12 Interface. 
 - I use Adobe Audition as my primary DAW.
 - I am capable of remote recording sessions via Zoom and Discord, and am in the process of learning how to use Source Connect.
